# PrintOS

**A custom-built operating system and kernel project written from scratch.**

PrintOS is a personal operating system project built for learning, experimentation, and low-level systems development. The project includes a custom kernel and OS components developed without generative AI or AI coding assistants.

## About

PrintOS is developed from the ground up with a focus on understanding how operating systems work at a low level.

The project currently includes work on areas such as:

* Custom kernel development
* Hardware and device communication
* PS/2 keyboard and mouse input
* Framebuffer graphics
* Basic graphical OS components
* Terminal functionality
* Taskbar and desktop components
* Memory and system management
* Low-level C/C++ development
* Custom build systems and tooling

PrintOS is an ongoing project and is intended primarily for experimentation, learning, and development.

## Source Code

**The PrintOS source code is 100% human-written.**

The source code was created entirely by the Author, **lexyleinchen**, without the use of:

* Generative AI
* AI coding assistants
* AI-generated source code
* AI-generated modifications
* AI-generated contributions

AI was used only to assist with drafting and wording of certain project documentation, including this README and the accompanying custom license. AI assistance was **not** used to write the PrintOS source code.

## License

PrintOS is distributed under the **PrintOS Custom Non-Commercial License (PCNCL) v1.0**.

See the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file for the complete terms.

### Important Restrictions

Under the PCNCL:

* Credit must always be given to **lexyleinchen**.
* Commercial use is not permitted without prior written permission.
* Commercial permission must be provided in a physical written document personally signed by the Author.
* Selling, licensing, renting, leasing, monetizing, or commercially exploiting PrintOS or qualifying derivative works is prohibited without that permission.
* Forks and qualifying derivative works remain subject to the PCNCL.
* The license and its restrictions must not be removed or bypassed.
* AI processing of the source code is prohibited.
* AI-generated source code may not be added to PrintOS or qualifying derivative works.

Please read the full `LICENSE` file before using, modifying, forking, or distributing this project.

## Forks and Derivative Works

Forking PrintOS does not remove the requirements of the PCNCL.

A fork, modification, port, extension, integration, or other work that qualifies as a derivative work under the license must continue to comply with the license, including its:

* Attribution requirements
* Non-commercial requirements
* AI restrictions
* License-preservation requirements
* Redistribution restrictions

Simply changing the project name, repository, programming language, build system, or structure does not automatically remove these requirements.

## Building from Source

To build PrintOS yourself, you need a suitable cross-compilation toolchain.

The build environment requires:

* GCC cross-compiler
* G++ cross-compiler
* GNU `ld` from the cross-compilation toolchain
* NASM
* GNU Make

The cross-compiler should be configured for the target architecture used by PrintOS rather than compiling the kernel with the host system's default compiler.

Once the required toolchain is installed and configured, clone the repository and run the following commands from the PrintOS project directory:

```bash
make clean
make
make iso
```

### Build Commands

**1. Clean previous build files**

```bash
make clean
```

Removes previous build artifacts so the project can be rebuilt from a clean state.

**2. Build PrintOS**

```bash
make
```

Compiles and links the PrintOS kernel and OS components.

**3. Create the ISO**

```bash
make iso
```

Creates a bootable PrintOS ISO from the compiled project.

The resulting ISO can then be used with an emulator, virtual machine, or compatible physical hardware.

> **Note:** The exact cross-compiler target and toolchain configuration depend on the architecture and build configuration used by the current PrintOS source tree.

## Prebuilt ISO

You do **not** need to build PrintOS yourself if you only want to try the operating system.

A prebuilt ISO is provided with the project's **GitHub Releases**.

Download the latest [`releases`](release) ISO and use it directly with a virtual machine, emulator, or compatible hardware.

This is the recommended option if you simply want to test PrintOS without setting up the complete development and cross-compilation environment.

## Development

PrintOS is an experimental project and is actively developed over time.

The architecture, APIs, features, and implementation may change without notice.

If you are studying the project, you are encouraged to read the source code and understand how the individual components interact.

## Project Status

**Status:** In Development

PrintOS is not intended to be considered a finished or production-ready operating system.

Features may be incomplete, unstable, experimental, or subject to significant changes.

## Author

**lexyleinchen**

PrintOS is independently developed as a custom operating system and kernel project.

## AI Documentation Disclosure

Parts of the project documentation, including this README and the custom license, were drafted with assistance from generative AI.

This disclosure applies **only to documentation drafting**.

The PrintOS source code itself remains **100% human-written** and was created by the Author without generative AI, AI coding assistants, or AI-generated code.
